# What is this?
These are general instructions for setting up a development environment for anybody starting out with python. Even though it facilitates the ability to start using/contributing to this project, it can be understood as a general setup for anybody who wants to accelerate the way she works with python. Besides detailing installation and usage steps for the kinds of popular data-sciency tools we'll be working with, brief conceptual overviews are included so that this document can also be thought of as a beginner's guide to the python development ecosystem.

**NOTE**: This development setup is biased and reflects what I have found works best for me over the years. This is not the only way to do things, but it _is_ a surefire way to get started quickly in terms of working with this project, and can supercharge any beginner's python workflow, for almost whatever they want to do.

**NOTE**: These instructions are specific to Mac or Linux operating systems. If you're working on a Windows machine, some of the following may not work for you. The concepts are, of course, still relevant though.
